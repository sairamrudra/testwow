What are the data security standards to be following for Cloud based systems ? 

Are there any standards to be compliance with ? If so, what are they ?
How are our competitors addressing this issue ?
What content / information we need to present on our website to make customer comfortable with the system ?

Pls work on above and we need to have solution/process in place by end of this week.

Amazon owns and maintains their own servers and files are protected with an SSL-encrypted transfer, the files aren't encrypted while at rest on the servers


This is in stark contrast to secure cloud storage services that make security a priority by providing zero-knowledge encryption.


Amazon Cloud Drive does provide a two-step verification option. Also known as two-factor authentication, this is a critical security measure that requires an additional step to the login process – a step that requires your presence to gain access to your account. One of the most common ways hackers access an account is by acquiring a password. With two-step verification, you enter your password and this sends a PIN to you via text, phone call or email. In this way, your immediate attention is required.




The Amazon AWS cloud service is fine for enterprise workloads and applying security controls such as encryption and firewalls is possible
Amazon has a built-in firewall but it is fairly “coarse-grained” and many enterprise managers using Amazon choose to include third-party software host-based firewalls, though some vendor products fit more gracefully as they were designed for it

Several vendors have encryption agents for Amazon, including Porticor, Safenet, Voltage and Vormetric, among others. Amazon offers encryption as well. AlienVault and Splunk have security information and event management products for Amazon’s EC2. CloudPassage, Trend Micro, Dome9 and McAfee (the security division of Intel) offer varieties of server-based security for Amazon.


MacDonald says he recommends a white-listing-based server protection strategy with continuous monitoring. He advises avoiding use of SSH keys.

The biggest mistakes companies make with data security are...

 Emailing unencrypted data
  Re-using passwords
  Sharing passwords


I suspect that organizations will continue to defend themselves against cyber attacks and the public's data will continue to be leaked in several successful data breaches. So, my advice to companies who want to protect themselves from security threats is...

 Make sure employees use strong passwords on all devices. Passwords are the first line of defense, so make sure employees use passwords that have upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. It's also important to use a separate password for each registered site and to change it every 30-60 days. A password management system can help by automating this process and eliminating the need for staff to remember multiple passwords.
 Train employees on cyber security best practices and offer ongoing support. Some employees may not know how to protect themselves online, which can put your business data at risk. Hold a training session to help employees learn how to manage passwords and avoid hacking through criminal activity like phishing and keylogger scams. Provide ongoing support to make sure employees have the resources they need.
 Hold employees accountable. It's crucial to make sure everyone in the company understands how important it is to use effective cyber security practices. Managers and business owners should lead by example, modeling excellent safety habits. It's also a good idea to provide an online security manual and ask employees to sign an acknowledgement form after training to indicate they understand and will abide by company policies.
